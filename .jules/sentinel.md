## 2025-02-18 - Path Traversal in Download Script
**Vulnerability:** Path Traversal in `scripts/download.py` allows arbitrary directory creation via `repo_id`.
**Learning:** Utilities that handle file paths based on user input, even in local scripts, must validate that the output path stays within expected boundaries.
**Prevention:** Use `pathlib.Path.resolve()` to canonicalize paths and check that the target path is within the intended root directory.
